# fm - FileManager

> FileManager written in php with Object Oriented Programming.

##NOTE THIS IS NOT COMPLETE YET, STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. I'LL UPDATE THIS IN MY SPARE TIME.

##Current Scope.

* Navigate through your server(traverse the directories).

##TODO - I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT.

* can be enabled login with password..
* can be enabled - connect with database to log every activity.
* file upload.
* fix permissions.
* better ui.
* unzip files.
* delete,
* create folder,
* zip content,
* etc.

## Notice

### Why

* I involved in this, just because i wanted to know php a little better.
* And Wrtiting a filemanager from scratch is cool.

### Apology.

* Sorry if i offended someone with my php writing skills.
* You can give your suggestions, if you feel if something can be improved.

## Usage

* Put the file in some folder of your server, that is literally it.

## Built With

* PHP WITH OOP.
