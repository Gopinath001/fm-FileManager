# fm - FileManager

> FileManager written in php with Object Oriented Programming.

## ***STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. I'LL UPDATE THIS IN MY SPARE TIME.***

## Current Scope.

* Navigate through your server(traverse the directories).
* login with password. (sha256 with 10000 rounds)
```
username:anything
passowrd:admin

```

## TODO - I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT.

- [x] ~~login with password.~~ (turned on or off)
- [ ] connect with database to log every activity. (turned on or off)
- [ ] file upload.
- [ ] fix permissions.
- [ ] better ui.
- [ ] unzip files.
- [ ] delete,
- [ ] create folder,
- [ ] zip content,
- [ ] etc.

## Notice

### Why

* I involved in this, just because i wanted to know php a little better.
* And Wrtiting a filemanager from scratch is cool.

### Apology.

* Sorry if i offended someone with my php writing skills.
* You can give your suggestions, if you feel if something can be improved.

## Usage

* Put the file in some folder of your server, that is literally it.

## Built With

* PHP WITH OOP.
* HTML,CSS, JS.
